The zm-w0002 is a super-cheap outdoor security camera that you can [pick up on Amazon](http://amzn.to/2kwasCJ) in a 4-pack for $99.99.

I know what you're thinking... *Dude, you can't shake a stick at 4 weatherproof wifi cameras delivered to my door for $100.*  Unfortunately, you can.  These cameras are so cheap because Zmodo has removed every feature you might want to setup a *secure* locale *security* system and instead ships all of your data to their questionable cloud service for later viewing on their proprietary mobile app.  Out of the box, these cameras will not work with *anything* other than the proprietary kitsch they're bundled with.

Luckily, it's powered by the popular and well documented HiSilicon Hi3518 SoC ([Datasheet](https://github.com/cilynx/zm-w0002/files/782566/Hi3518-Datasheet.pdf), [User Guide](https://github.com/cilynx/zm-w0002/files/782568/Hi3518-UserGuide.pdf)).
